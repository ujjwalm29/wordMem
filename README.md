## WordMem : About the Project

Preparing for GRE vocab is tough. There are hundreds and thousands of words to remember for the exam. A lot of times when we try and memorize a bunch of words in a list, our memory gets trained to recollect words only in the order that was present in the original list. This is a challenge.

To overcome this, the use of flashcards is recommended. Digital form of flashcards is available as an app. But it does not have the feature to make your own word list. Some people cut pieces of paper and make their own physical cards to remember words. It is a tedious task and managing them is a challenge. Isn't there any platform in which a user can enter their own word list and practice them in a randomized order?

Enter WordMem.

Here, you can store your own list of words and practice them repeatedly in a randomized order.

## How To Use it ?

Right now the app is extremely basic. It is not hosted anywhere. Hence, you will have to follow the development process to get the app up and running in your system until it is hosted.

## Some stuff about development

The web app uses Spring framework and Postgres as of now to work. Configure the application.properties with the relevant variables to connect to postgres. Use an IDE to start the development server and go ahead and use it.
